# Internal IT Audit and Risk Assessment for Botium Toys Using NIST Cybersecurity Framework
<h2>Projects Descriptions</h2>
<p>This project involved conducting an internal IT audit for a fictional small business, Botium Toys, which operates both a physical storefront and an expanding online presence. As the company scales its digital operations to serve a growing global customer base, particularly in the U.S. and E.U., the IT department needed to evaluate its cybersecurity posture to ensure regulatory compliance and protect critical business assets.

<h3>The project began by reviewing the audit Scope, Goals, and Risk assessment provided by the IT manager. Using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF), I completed the following tasks:</h3>
   <li> Analyzed existing IT assets and identified potential threats, vulnerabilities, and risks.</li>
   <li> Assessed the company’s current controls and security measures.</li>
   <li> Evaluated compliance with industry standards and regulations, including those related to online payment processing and E.U. data protection laws (e.g., GDPR).</li>
   <li> Completed a detailed controls and compliance checklist to assess the effectiveness of current practices.</li>
   <li> Highlighted potential fines and operational risks stemming from identified security gaps.</li>
   <li> Highlighted potential fines and operational risks stemming from identified security gaps.</li>
   <li> Recommended practical mitigation strategies to enhance Botium Toys’ cybersecurity resilience and regulatory compliance.</li> <br>
This audit simulated a real-world approach to cybersecurity risk management and regulatory readiness, demonstrating my ability to apply structured frameworks and critical thinking in evaluating and improving an organization’s cybersecurity posture

Portfolio Project Summary

Project Title: Internal IT Audit for Botium Toys Using NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)

Overview:
I conducted an internal IT audit for Botium Toys, a U.S.-based toy company with growing online operations. The audit was designed to assess the organization’s overall security posture, compliance with regulations, and ability to protect critical assets. The focus was on aligning their security program with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) while identifying risks, gaps, and necessary control implementations.

Scope & Goals:

Scope: Entire Botium Toys security program including employee devices, internal network, IT systems, warehouse/storefront assets, and legacy systems.

Goals: Evaluate existing assets, review compliance with U.S. and E.U. regulations, and recommend controls to mitigate risks.

Process & How I Did the Project:

Reviewed Scope & Risk Report: Examined the IT manager’s scope, goals, and initial risk assessment (rated 8/10 risk score).

Asset Review: Identified critical assets including on-premise devices, e-commerce platforms, customer data, and legacy systems.

Compliance & Control Checklist: Mapped existing practices against NIST CSF categories (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover).

Gap Analysis:

Found lack of encryption for credit card data (PCI-DSS non-compliance).

Discovered no backup or disaster recovery plan.

Weak password policies and no centralized password management.

Missing IDS/IPS for network monitoring.

Control Recommendations:

Administrative Controls: Implement least privilege, account lifecycle policies, and updated password complexity rules.

Technical Controls: Deploy IDS/IPS, enforce encryption for payment/PII, implement centralized password management, and establish automated backups.

Physical Controls: Enhance access restrictions with locking cabinets for network gear and improve security signage.

Outcome: Delivered an internal audit report highlighting risks of non-compliance (PCI-DSS, GDPR) and suggested prioritized remediation steps to reduce the organization’s risk score from 8 to a more acceptable level.

Key Skills Demonstrated:

Cybersecurity frameworks (NIST CSF)

Risk assessment & compliance analysis (PCI-DSS, GDPR)

Security controls evaluation (administrative, technical, physical)

Audit reporting & recommendations
