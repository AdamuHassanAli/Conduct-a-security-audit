# Internal IT Audit and Risk Assessment for Botium Toys Using NIST Cybersecurity Framework
<h2>Projects Descriptions</h2>
<p>This project involved conducting an internal IT audit for a fictional small business, Botium Toys, which operates both a physical storefront and an expanding online presence. As the company scales its digital operations to serve a growing global customer base, particularly in the U.S. and E.U., the IT department needed to evaluate its cybersecurity posture to ensure regulatory compliance and protect critical business assets.

The project began by reviewing the audit scope, objectives, and preliminary risk assessment provided by the IT manager. Using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF), I completed the following tasks:</p>
<li>Analyzed existing IT assets and identified potential threats, vulnerabilities, and risks.</li>
<li>Assessed the company’s current controls and security measures.</li>
<li>Evaluated compliance with industry standards and regulations, including those related to online payment processing and E.U. data protection laws (e.g., GDPR).</li>
<li>Completed a detailed controls and compliance checklist to assess the effectiveness of current practices.</li>
<li>Highlighted potential fines and operational risks stemming from identified security gaps.</li>
<li>Highlighted potential fines and operational risks stemming from identified security gaps.</li>
<li>Recommended practical mitigation strategies to enhance Botium Toys’ cybersecurity resilience and regulatory compliance.</li>
This audit simulated a real-world approach to cybersecurity risk management and regulatory readiness, demonstrating my ability to apply structured frameworks and critical thinking in evaluating and improving an organization’s cybersecurity posture
