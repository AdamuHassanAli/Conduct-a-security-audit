# Internal IT Audit and Risk Assessment for Botium Toys Using NIST Cybersecurity Framework
<h2>Projects Descriptions</h2>
<p>This project involved conducting an internal IT audit for a fictional small business, Botium Toys, which operates both a physical storefront and an expanding online presence. As the company scales its digital operations to serve a growing global customer base, particularly in the U.S. and E.U., the IT department needed to evaluate its cybersecurity posture to ensure regulatory compliance and protect critical business assets.

<h3>The project began by reviewing the audit Scope, Goals, and Risk assessment provided by the IT manager. Using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF), I completed the following tasks:</h3>
   <li> Analyzed existing IT assets and identified potential threats, vulnerabilities, and risks.</li>
   <li> Assessed the company‚Äôs current controls and security measures.</li>
   <li> Evaluated compliance with industry standards and regulations, including those related to online payment processing and E.U. data protection laws (e.g., GDPR).</li>
   <li> Completed a detailed controls and compliance checklist to assess the effectiveness of current practices.</li>
   <li> Highlighted potential fines and operational risks stemming from identified security gaps.</li>
   <li> Highlighted potential fines and operational risks stemming from identified security gaps.</li>
   <li> Recommended practical mitigation strategies to enhance Botium Toys‚Äô cybersecurity resilience and regulatory compliance.</li> <br>
This audit simulated a real-world approach to cybersecurity risk management and regulatory readiness, demonstrating my ability to apply structured frameworks and critical thinking in evaluating and improving an organization‚Äôs cybersecurity posture

# üìä Portfolio Project Summary

## Project Title  
**Internal IT Audit for Botium Toys Using NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**  

---

## üîé Overview  
I conducted an internal IT audit for **Botium Toys**, a U.S.-based toy company with growing online operations.  
The audit assessed the organization‚Äôs **security posture, regulatory compliance, and protection of critical assets**,  
aligned with the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**.  

---

## üéØ Scope & Goals  
**Scope:** Entire Botium Toys security program (devices, network, IT systems, warehouse/storefront, legacy systems).  
**Goals:** Evaluate existing assets, review compliance (U.S. & E.U.), recommend controls to mitigate risks.  

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Process & How I Did the Project  
- **Reviewed Scope & Risk Report**: Examined IT manager‚Äôs scope, goals, and initial risk assessment (risk score: 8/10).  
- **Asset Review**: Identified critical assets (on-prem devices, e-commerce, customer data, legacy systems).  
- **Compliance & Checklist**: Mapped practices against NIST CSF (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover).  
- **Gap Analysis:**  
  - No encryption for cardholder data (**PCI-DSS non-compliance**)  
  - No backup/disaster recovery plan  
  - Weak password policies; no centralized password management  
  - Missing IDS/IPS monitoring  

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Control Recommendations  
- **Administrative Controls:** Least privilege, account lifecycle policies, stronger password rules  
- **Technical Controls:** IDS/IPS deployment, encryption (PII & payment data), centralized password management, backups  
- **Physical Controls:** Locking cabinets for network gear, improved security signage  

---

## ‚úÖ Outcome  
Produced an **audit report** with prioritized remediation steps to reduce risk exposure and improve compliance  
(PCI-DSS, GDPR). Helped reduce risk score from **8/10 to a safer level**.  

---

## üß© Key Skills Demonstrated  
- Cybersecurity frameworks (**NIST CSF**)  
- **Risk assessment & compliance analysis** (PCI-DSS, GDPR)  
- Security controls evaluation (**administrative, technical, physical**)  
- **Audit reporting & recommendations**  

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tools & Frameworks Used  
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)  
- Compliance standards: PCI-DSS, GDPR  
- Audit methodologies & control checklists
